  This project is an interactive text adventure game. It incorporates a database that allows a user to create a account that keeps track of where they are in the story. Ambiance is also created using various datapoints in the database in order to immerse the player in the enviornment.

  ## Installation
  If you are reading this, you've already found the repo, so good on you for that! The next step will be to clone the repo onto your computer. Make sure that you have the node modules in package-json installed. The last thing you'll need to make sure of is that you have MySQL set up, and enter in your usernmame and password in a .env file. The database name is player_db.

  ## Usage
  Once you have the code on your computer, make sure that you start the server by running "npm start" in your terminal. Once that happens, navigate to the localhost in your browser of choice, and make sure you're on port 3001. Sign up with a new account, login, and enjoy!
